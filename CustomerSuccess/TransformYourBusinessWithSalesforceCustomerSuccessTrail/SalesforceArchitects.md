This README summarizes  units from the [Salesforce Architects](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-architects?trail_id=transform-business-sf-expeditions) Trailhead module.

# [1. Use Technology to Innovate](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-architects/use-technology-to-innovate?trail_id=transform-business-sf-expeditions)

### Learning objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to:
* Explain how embracing new technology can help your company innovate,
* Describe what a Salesforce Architect does.

### Embracing new technology
Strong customer relationships aren't just about rolling out new apps every quarter or fielding customer concerns 24/7. It’s an ongoing journey that starts with getting everyone in your company to embrace new technology to create unique customer experiences.

Four ways to get your organization to start thinking about new technology:
* **Start with the end in mind**: Find out what your customers value most, then customize your technology needs accordingly. Don't launch a new digital channel for customer service until you have a clear vision of your customers’ needs,
*  **Speed with collaboration**: Part of being agile means working cross-functionally with other teams. Consider this: "To respond faster to market demands, IT can’t develop apps without regular interactions with the business side. Instead of working in separate functional teams that oversee end-to-end product development cycles, organize your teams around shorter and more focused efforts that speed up delivering better experiences to your customers",
*  **Progress over perfection**: Environment is changing fast, so customer's demands. Make small changes to your app or your platform, test, and then iterate quickly based on feedback. Don't strive for perfection with every release, strive for progress,
*  **New ways of using technology**: Moving from spreadsheets to digital systems requires both a change in processes and your organization’s view on customer data. When your sales teams don’t log their interactions with customers because they think it’s a meaningless task, the marketing team won’t have good customer insights when building relevant campaigns. When leadership doesn’t have accurate forecasting based on market demand, they can’t make smart decisions,
*  **It’s also for your leaders**: Your executives ultimately make the decisions on what technology investments go and what investments stay. To ensure that lasting change takes place in how your entire organization consistently fulfills your customers’ needs, your executives should stay engaged after you go live by using the technology themselves.

### Salesforce Architect duty
When you're trying to get your entire organization on board, it's not about solving all your challenges in one day, but creating your unique roadmap one step at a time. You are a platform and subject matter expert who provides strategic and technical guidance to customers. And you are designing customable apps for them.

# [2. Get Support from Salesforce Architects](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/content/learn/modules/salesforce-architects/get-support-from-salesforce-architects?trail_id=transform-business-sf-expeditions)

### Learning objectives

* Explain how Salesforce Architects help customers,
* Describe the four types of Salesforce Architects.

### The Salesforce Architect features and ways of help
* Helps organization to identify business and technical goals,
* Works with the teams to execute on these plans,
* Has several domain-specific certifications achieved through a [specialized learning journey](https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/career-path/architect/),
* At least 10 years of experience advising customers with their Salesforce implementations and programs (enriched with peer-to-peer field coaching from experienced Certified Technical Architects),
* **Unmatched Salesforce expertise** - his breadth of industry and vertical knowledge can help you reach your business goals, whether that means reducing costs or driving new revenue. Here are other ways they can help:

  * Align Salesforce roadmap to business strategy and prioritization,
  * Ensure implementations adhere to best practices and standards,
  * Optimize data and Salesforce org integration strategies,
  * Provide guidance on deploying apps and other customizations,
  * Minimize architectural complexity.

* **Direct access to Salesforce innovation** - Salesforce's product roadmap and:

  * Architecture best practices,
  * Maximum use of product and platform capabilities to improve adoption,
  * R&D knowledge and product management expertise,
  * Agile workflows and processes.

* **Embedded in Your teams** - Architects are embedded within your team and can be your direct line to learn about the latest Salesforce innovations, proven best practices, and unparalleled product expertise—all combining to help you get the most from your Salesforce investment.
  * Help build prototypes for advanced features, product enhancements, and new Salesforce innovations,
  * Optimization of future release management plans,
  * Act as your strategic advisor for enterprise architecture.

### Four types of Salesforce Architects
* **Business Architect**: Let them plan which Salesforce products and features to launch and when to launch them based on your unique business needs. They’ll work with your sales, service, marketing, and IT leaders to make sure their teams’ goals can be achieved, based on how you use Salesforce,
* **Program Architect**: Once you have your business goals mapped out and you know how you’ll use Salesforce, you’ll need someone with deep platform expertise and experience designing IT architectures and systems to guide your development and operations teams to execute on your roadmap. Program Architects can help you unify data sources (and Salesforce orgs too!), integrate multiple Salesforce products, and get your teams delivering solutions faster. They’re both your pilot and engineer. They not only understand how your plane is built, they can also lead a team to fly you where you want to go,
* **Implementation Architect**: Sometimes, on your way to your destination, you need to gas up, buy new supplies, or even change your mode of transportation. Implementation Architects provide app-focused guidance to ensure your new or existing implementation of Salesforce uses best practices—they’ll help make sure you have everything you need (and ensure that you don’t overpack!),
* **Design Architects**: As you find new and better ways to get to your destination, you sometimes need to personalize it for yourself and your fellow travelers. When you need to create personalized customer experiences, consider getting guidance from Salesforce Design Architects. They’re user interaction (UI) and user experience (UX) experts. Experience strategists use persona-based methods and design thinking to help you understand how your customers, employees, or partners use Salesforce. They can help you create journey maps, define user personas, and create prototypes of new ideas.
