### Factors common to digital transformation projects
Advances in robotics, artificial intelligence, and IoT give organizations an opportunity to accomplish new things. There are three key characteristics that nearly all digital transformation projects share:
* **Design First**: make technology as easy, intuitive and delightful for users as much as it can be. If we can deliver a personalized experience to each customer, outcomes are better compared to those of a standardized delivery. Think about what frustrates users when they’re doing business with you. If you want to succeed, you need to approach users' experiences with an empathetic mindset and a willingness to implement more customizable solutions,
* **Culture**: Change management is crucial. Be sure to cultivate a culture that embraces change and addresses head-on the experience of the people who are implementing the changes and the users on the receiving end. Without actively fostering digital cultural characteristics, such as customer centricity, responsiveness or breaking down the silos that traditionally exist between business and IT, digital transformation efforts flounder,
* **Speed and Agility**: Salesforce company culture encourages honest feedback from all of our stakeholders. This is a key point that many companies that we work with haven’t realized yet: Being agile isn’t just about more frequent product releases. It also means rethinking your operational structure, so you can be more responsive to your stakeholders’ needs.

### Real-world example of digital transformation
* **Toyota** has consolidated multiple systems into a single application for its call center agents, significantly improving customer experience. The company is seeing significant improvements in customer and agent satisfaction,
* **The University of Texas** is rethinking the online résumé and inventing new ways for students to share their accomplishments with potential employers. In doing so, the school is creating an entirely new marketplace to connect people in the workplace.

### Learning objectives
After completing this unit, you’ll be able to::
* Describe the obstacles that companies can face on their digital transformation journey,
* Explain the business value of digital transformation.

### Obstacles that companies can face on their digital transformation journey
Many times, the poor results can be attributed to one or more of these reasons:
* **Inadequate change management**: Failing to invest adequately in change management resources can sink any major initiative. Transformation projects require a detailed communication and training plan. If your users can’t answer, “What’s in it for me?” and “Why should I care?” about a digital transformation initiative, the project is likely to fail,
* **Lack of C-level sponsorship**: True digital transformation touches nearly every aspect of an organization. Everyone across the company needs to be on board, and that starts at the top. As any veteran project manager can tell you, the support of senior leadership is critical to success,
* **Talent deficits**: The skill sets of top technology talent are different today than they were even 5 years ago. User experience experts who can make beautiful apps for any device, data scientists who can extract insights from enormous data sets, IoT engineers to connect products—talented people with these backgrounds are in demand.

### The Business Value of Digital Transformation
Changing your corporate culture and strengthening customer relationships requires money, time, and people, but the investment can pay off. Based on studies, companies that invest more in digital transformation outperform their peers over time. Those companies are more prepared for disruption. They are better able to take advantage of new digital channels and build a larger, stronger user base. Companies that invest in digital transformation also see increased revenue, improved customer satisfaction survey results, and improved employee productivity as a result of their efforts.
